# Home-Labs
This repository covers network diagrams, configurations, and hardware used in my home lab.

## Purpose
A visual and written representation to my personal home lab used in my home environment. This serves as a point of reference for my knowledge and third-party viewers who'd like to see into my build and determine if my skills suite their needs. As a secondary purpose, if any new to homelabbing user want's to view a diagram and see configurations that are used in a home lab that focuses on network infrastructure, network security, and automations; this repository will also present a visual path for them to replicate and learn from.
